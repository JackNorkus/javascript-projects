      Starting out, I would like to make a website which allows users to input
      a musical chord, and suggest a few of the other chords in the same key
      to try going along with that chord. For example, if a user puts in
      C major, I could suggest F or G major. I would also like to create some
      sound samples and put those samples on the website, so users can preview
      the chords before they try putting them together.
